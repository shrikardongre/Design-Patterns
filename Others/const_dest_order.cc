/*
Why constructors cannot be virtual:

Object type must be known at creation

When you do new Derived(), the compiler must know the exact type (Derived) at compile time so it can allocate the right size and lay out the vtable.

Virtual dispatch requires a vtable pointer, but that vtable isnâ€™t set up until after the base constructor finishes.

So at the moment of construction, thereâ€™s no mechanism for polymorphic dispatch.

Thatâ€™s why constructors canâ€™t be virtual.

ðŸ”¹ Why destructors can be virtual:

At destruction, dynamic type matters

If you delete an object through a base pointer (delete basePtr;), the compiler needs to destroy the most-derived object.

Virtual dispatch works here, because the vtable is still valid until the most-derived destructor starts.

So a virtual ~Base() ensures the derived destructor runs first, cleaning up derived resources, before base cleanup.
